<br> I am a Machine Learning engineer at <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>, working in the Globalization team. 
We apply machine learning based solutions to enhance customer experience of Adobe’s global product. 
 My research interests lie in the application of multimodal machine learning. In 2020, I finished my Masters in 
 Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/">University of Maryland College Park</a>. Previously, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science 
 from <a href = "https://www.iiitd.ac.in/"> IIIT Delhi</a> in 2018 and was advised by <a href = "https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/">Dr. Chetan Arora</a>.
In 2017, I was a research intern at CMU advised by <a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abhinavg/">Dr. Abhinav Gupta </a>.<br><br>
<br>

    When I’m not doing MLxxxxxxxxxxx, I like to read (fiction: mystery, thrillers, non-fiction: narrative, science, 
    self-help, health, finance & economics), work out, listen to music (genre depends on my mood) and
    watch movies/TV (currently rewatching Harry Potter).<br>

<b>Why Globalization?</b><br><br>

Coming from a multi cultural place like India, I have a fair understanding of people from diverse backgrounds and understanding their needs and concerns and am curious to only learn more. So when I heard that I can do my bit to make AI inclusive, 
I jumped at that opportunity to make lives for global users easier one product at a time.
